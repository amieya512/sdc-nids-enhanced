## **Role 2 – XML Parsing**  
**Name:** CJ Faircloth  
**Description:**  
Implemented the XML parsing component of the pipeline by creating two files:

xml_parser.py contains the required 'parse_xml(xml_string)' function.  
This function:

- Returns **(root, False)** if the XML string is *valid* and successfully parsed
